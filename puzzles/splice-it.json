  "intro": "This puzzle demostrates one of the many JS traps. The special <code>arguments</code> object is a handy local variable in all functions. It acts a bit like an Array, but it's missing a few features.",
  "code": [
    "var meow = function() {",
    "  var answer = undefined;",
    "  var args = <span>arguments</span>;",
    "  return args.pop();",
    "}",
    "",
    "var answer = Math.random();",
    "var cats = meow(answer);",
    "assert(cats, answer);"
  ],
  "hint": "It looks like <code>Array.prototype</code> has a <code>pop</code> function.",
